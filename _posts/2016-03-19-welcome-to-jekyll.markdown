You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
class Word(object):
    def __init__(self, word):
        self.word = word

def print_hi(obj):
  print 'Hi, {}'.format(obj.word)
print_hi(Word('World'))
# prints 'Hi, World' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
