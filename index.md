## About

I'm a Principal AI Scientist at [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) and a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://taur.cs.utexas.edu/) where I am co-advised by [Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/) and [Eunsol Choi](https://eunsol.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in deep learning for natural language processing. My current research focuses on reasoning, consistency, factuality, and post-training in the context of neural language models.

Before joining Indeed, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon where I primarily worked on deep learning for ranking and recommender systems. I received my MS in Computer Science from [Western Michigan University](https://wmich.edu/).
