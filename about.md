# About
My name is Thom Lake. I am a Computer Scientist specializing in Machine Learning. I received my M.S. in 2015 and currently lead the Algorithm R&D efforts at [Atlas Wearables](https://www.atlaswearables.com/) where my work focuses on the design and implementation of algorithms for complex gesture recognition. 

I'm particularly interested in Structured Input/Output, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Bayesian methods, and Online Learning. I equally enjoy experimentation and implementation, and try to strike a balance between theory and making things go.
