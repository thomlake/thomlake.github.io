My name is Thom Lake. I'm a graduate student in the Computer 
Science department at Western Michigan University focusing 
on Machine Learning and Statistical Natural Language Processing.
I try to split my time fairly evenly between the Math and CS departments.
I'm currently interested in unsupervised grammar induction and feature learning
for NLP, but have studied everything from Deep Learning to Statistical Learning Theory to 
Online Learning in the past. I like to make things go. 
My favorite language is currently <a href="http://julialang.org/">
Julia</a>. I also write a lot of <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and 
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Scheme</a>. You can find me on 
github <a href="https://github.com/thomlake?tab=repositories">here</a>.
I'm also fairly active on a couple stackexchange sites.<br /><br />
