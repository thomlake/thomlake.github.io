<div class="home">
  third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at New York University (Courant Institute), working with Eunsol Choi. I am interested in natural language processing and machine learning.

I spent the first two years of my Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin before transferring out. Previously, I graduated from Cornell University with a M.Eng in Computer Science and the University of Hong Kong with a B.Eng in Computer Science. I also spent some time in the industry -- I interned at Allen Institute for AI (Summer 2023) and worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Twitter.
